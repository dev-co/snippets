From wikipedia:
"A pastebin is a web application which allows its users to upload snippets of text, 
usually samples of source code, for public viewing. It is very popular in IRC channels 
where pasting large amounts of text is considered bad etiquette. A vast number of 
pastebins exist on the Internet, suiting a number of different needs and provided 
features tailored towards the crowd they focus on most."

Snippets is a pastebin application made with ruby, runs on the google applicaction engine
using jruby using sinatra and data_mapper.
